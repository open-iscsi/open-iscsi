1.  Introduction

   iSCSI [RFC3720] is a protocol used to transport SCSI [SAM2] commands,
   data, and status across an IP network.  This protocol is connection-
   oriented and is currently defined over TCP.  iSCSI uses a client-
   server relationship.  The client end of the connection is an
   initiator, and it sends SCSI commands; the server end of the
   connection is called a target, and it receives and executes the
   commands.

   There are several methods an iSCSI initiator can use to find the
   targets to which it should connect.  Two of these methods can be
   accomplished without the use of SLP:

   - Each target and its address can be statically configured on the
     initiator.

   - Each address providing targets can be configured on the initiator;
     iSCSI provides a mechanism by which the initiator can query the
     address for a list of targets.

   The above methods are further defined in "iSCSI Naming and Discovery
   Requirements" [RFC3721].

   Each of the above methods requires a small amount of configuration to
   be done on each initiator.  The ability to discover targets and name
   services without having to configure initiators is a desirable
   feature.  The Service Location Protocol (SLP) [RFC2608] is an IETF
   standards track protocol providing several features that will
   simplify locating iSCSI services.  This document describes how SLP
   can be used in iSCSI environments to discover targets, addresses
   providing targets, and storage management servers.

3.  Terminology

   Here are some definitions that may aid readers who are unfamiliar
   with SLP, SCSI, or iSCSI.  Some of these definitions have been
   reproduced from [RFC2608] and "Finding an RSIP Server with SLP"
   [RFC3105].

   User Agent (UA)            A process working on the client's behalf
                              to establish contact with some service.
                              The UA retrieves service information from
                              the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

   Service Agent (SA)         A process working on behalf of one or more
                              services to advertise the services and
                              their capabilities.

   Directory Agent (DA)       A process that collects service
                              advertisements.  There can only be one DA
                              present per given host.

   Scope                      A named set of services, typically making
                              up a logical administrative group.

   Service Advertisement      A URL, attributes, and a lifetime
                              (indicating how long the advertisement is
                              valid) providing service access
                              information and capabilities description
                              for a particular service.

   Initiator                  A logical entity, typically within a host,
                              that sends SCSI commands to targets to be
                              executed.  An initiator is usually present
                              in the form of a device driver.

   Target                     A logical entity, typically within a
                              storage controller or gateway that
                              receives SCSI commands from an initiator
                              and executes them.  A target includes one
                              or more Logical Units (LUs); each LU is a
                              SCSI device, such as a disk or tape drive.

   iSCSI Name                 A UTF-8 character string that serves as a
                              unique identifier for iSCSI initiators and
                              targets.  Its format and usage is further
                              defined in [RFC3721].

   iSCSI Client               A logical entity, typically a host that
                              includes at least one iSCSI Initiator.

RFC 4018                    iSCSI and SLPv2                   April 2005


   iSCSI Server               A logical entity, typically a storage
                              controller or gateway that includes at
                              least one iSCSI Target.

   Storage Management Server  An addressable entity that provides
                              management services that benefit an iSCSI
                              environment.  "Storage management server"
                              is used as a generic term and does not
                              indicate a specific protocol or service.

4.  Using SLP for iSCSI Service Discovery

   Two entities are involved in iSCSI discovery.  The end result is that
   an iSCSI initiator (e.g., a host) discovers iSCSI targets, usually
   provided by storage controllers or gateways.

   iSCSI targets are registered with SLP as a set of service URLs, one
   for each address on which the target may be accessed.  Initiators
   discover these targets by using SLP service requests.  Targets that
   do not directly support SLP or that are under the control of a
   management service may be registered by a proxy service agent as part
   of the software providing this service.

   iSCSI entities may also use SLP to discover higher-level management
   services when these are needed.

   This section first describes the use of SLP for discovery of targets
   by iSCSI initiators, it then describes the use of SLP to discover
   storage management servers.

   This document assumes that SLPv2 will be used for discovering iSCSI-
   related services; no attempt is made to include support for SLPv1.

4.1.  Discovering iSCSI Targets with SLP

   The following diagram shows the relationship among iSCSI clients,
   servers, initiators, and targets.  An iSCSI client includes at least
   one iSCSI initiator, and an SLP user agent (UA).  An iSCSI server
   includes at least one iSCSI target an SLP service agent (SA).  Some
   entities, such as extended copy engines, include both initiators and
   targets.  These include both an SA, for its targets to be discovered,
   and a UA, for its initiator(s) to discover other targets.

              +-----------------------------------+

   In the above drawing, the iSCSI server has three iSCSI targets that
   the client could discover, named "one", "two" and "three".  The iSCSI
   client has an iSCSI initiator with the name "myhost".  The iSCSI
   client may use the initiator name in its SLP Service Requests as a
   filter to discover only targets that are configured to accept iSCSI
   connections from "myhost".

   Each iSCSI target and initiator has a unique name, called an iSCSI
   Name.  This identifier is the same regardless of the network path
   (through adapter cards, networks, and interfaces on the storage

   device) over which the target is discovered and accessed.  For this
   example, the iSCSI names "one", "two", and "three" are used for the
   targets; the initiator uses the name "myhost".  An actual iSCSI name
   would incorporate more structure, including a naming authority, and
   is not described here.

   Each of the iSCSI targets in the drawing can appear at two addresses,
   since two network interfaces are present.  Each target would have two
   service URLs, unless a single service URL included a DNS host name
   mapping to both addresses.

   An iSCSI target URL consists of its fully qualified host name or IP
   address, the TCP port on which it is listening, and its iSCSI name.
   An iSCSI server must register each of its individual targets at each
   of its network addresses.

   The iSCSI server constructs a service advertisement of the type
   "service:iscsi:target" for each of the service URLs it wishes to
   register.  The advertisement contains a lifetime, along with other
   attributes that are defined in the service template.

   If the server in the above drawing is listening at TCP port 3260 for
   both network addresses, the service URLs registered would be

   - 192.0.2.131:3260/one

   - 192.0.2.131:3260/two

   - 192.0.2.131:3260/three

   - 192.0.2.3:3260/one

   - 192.0.2.3:3260/two

   - 192.0.2.3:3260/three

   The remainder of the discovery procedure is identical to that used by
   any client/server pair implementing SLP:

   1.  If an SLP DA is found, the SA contacts the DA and registers the
       service advertisement.  Whether or not one or more SLPv2 DAs are
       discovered, the SA maintains the advertisement itself and answers
       multicast UA queries directly.

   2.  When the iSCSI initiator requires contact information for an
       iSCSI target, the UA either contacts the DA by using unicast or
       the SA by using multicast.  If a UA is configured with the
       address of the SA, it may avoid multicast and may contact an SA



Bakke & Hufferd             Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 4018                    iSCSI and SLPv2                   April 2005


       by using unicast.  The UA includes a query based on the
       attributes to indicate the characteristics of the target(s) it
       requires.

   3.  Once the UA has the host name or address of the iSCSI server, as
       well as the port number and iSCSI Target Name, it can begin the
       normal iSCSI login to the target.

   As information contained in the iSCSI target template may exceed
   common network datagram sizes, the SLP implementation for both UAs
   and SAs supporting this template MUST implement SLP over TCP.

4.1.1.  Finding Targets Based on Initiator Credentials

   To be allowed access to an iSCSI target, an initiator must be
   authenticated.  The initiator may be required by the target to
   produce one or more of the following credentials:

   - An iSCSI Initiator Name

   - An IP address

   - A CHAP, SRP, or Kerberos credential

   - Any combination of the above

   Most iSCSI targets allow access to only one or two initiators.  In
   the ideal discovery scenario, an initiator would send an SLP request
   and receive responses ONLY for targets to which the initiator is
   guaranteed a successful login.  To achieve this goal, the iSCSI
   target template contains the following attributes, each of which
   allows a list of values:

   1.  auth-name:  This attribute contains the list of initiator names
       allowed to access this target, or the value "any", indicating
       that no specific initiator name is required.

   2.  auth-addr:  This attribute contains the list of host names
       and/or IP addresses that will be allowed access to this target,
       or the value "any", indicating that no specific address or
       host name is required.  If a large number of addresses is to
       be allowed (perhaps a subnet), this attribute may contain the
       value "any".








Bakke & Hufferd             Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 4018                    iSCSI and SLPv2                   April 2005


   3.  auth-cred:  This attribute contains a list of "method/identifier"
       credentials that will be allowed access to the target, provided
       they can produce the correct password or other verifier during
       the login process.  If no specific credentials are required, the
       value "any" is used.

   The list of valid method strings for auth-cred are defined in
   [RFC3720], section 11.1, "AuthMethod".  The identifier used after the
   "/" is defined by the specific AuthMethod, also in [RFC3720].
   Examples showing initiator searches based on auth-xxxx attributes are
   shown in the target-specific template section below.

   Also note that the auth-xxxx attributes are considered security
   policy information.  If these attributes are distributed, IPsec MUST
   be implemented as specified in the Security Implementation section
   below.

4.1.2.  Supporting Access by Multiple Identities to the Same Target

   If a target is to allow access to multiple host identities, more than
   one combination of auth-xxxx attributes will have to be allowed.  In
   some of these cases, it is not possible to express the entire set of
   valid combinations of auth-xxxx attributes within a single registered
   service URL.  For example, if a target can be addressed by

      auth-name=myhost1 AND auth-cred=CHAP/user1      (identity1)

   OR

      auth-name-myhost2 AND auth-cred=CHAP/user2      (identity2)

   the above cannot be specified in a single registered service URL,
   since (auth-name=myhost1, auth-name=myhost2, auth-cred=CHAP/user1,
   auth-cred=CHAP/user2) would allow either auth-name to be used with
   either auth-cred.  This necessitates the ability to register a target
   and address under more than one service URL; one for (identity1) and
   one for (identity2).

   Because service URLs must be unique, (identity1) and (identity2) must
   each be registered under a unique service URL.  For systems that
   support the configuration of multiple identities to access a target,
   the service URL must contain an additional, opaque string defining
   the identity.  This appears after the iSCSI name in the URL string
   and is separated by a "/".  Each registered (target-address, target-
   name, initiator-identity) tuple can then register a set of auth-xxxx
   attributes.

4.1.3.  Using SLP in a Non-multicast Environment

   In some networks, the use of multicast for discovery purposes is
   either unavailable or not allowed.  These include public or service-
   provider networks that are placed between an iSCSI client and a
   server.  These are probably most common between two iSCSI gateways,
   one at a storage service provider site, and one at a customer site.

   In these networks, an initiator may allow the addresses of one or
   more SAs to be configured instead of or in addition to its DA
   configuration.  The initiator would then make unicast SLP service
   requests directly to these SAs, without the use of multicast to
   discover them first.

   This functionality is well within the scope of the current SLP
   protocol.  The main consequence for implementors is that an initiator
   configured to make direct unicast requests to an SA will have to add
   this to the SLP API, if it is following the service location API
   defined in [RFC2614].

4.2.  Discovering Storage Management Services with SLP

   Storage management servers can be built to manage and control access
   to targets in a variety of ways.  They can provide extended services
   beyond discovery, which could include storage allocation and
   management.  None of these services are defined here; the intent of
   this document is to allow these services to be discovered by both
   clients and servers, in addition to the target discovery already
   being performed.

   The following drawing shows an iSCSI client, an iSCSI server, and a
   storage management server.  To simplify the drawing, the second IP
   network is not shown but is assumed to exist.  The storage management
   server would use its own protocol (smsp) to provide capabilities to
   iSCSI clients and servers; these clients and servers can both use SLP
   to discover the storage management server.

   Note the difference between the storage management server model and
   the previously defined target discovery model.  When target discovery
   was used, the iSCSI Server implemented an SA, to be discovered by the
   initiator's UA.  In the storage management server model, the iSCSI
   clients and servers both implement UAs, and the management server
   implements the SA.

   A storage management server's URL contains the domain name or IP
   address and TCP or UDP port number.  No other information is
   required.

   The storage management server constructs a service advertisement of
   the type "service:iscsi:sms" for each of the addresses at which it
   appears.  The advertisement contains the URL and a lifetime, along
   with other attributes that are defined in the service template.



Bakke & Hufferd             Standards Track                    [Page 10]

RFC 4018                    iSCSI and SLPv2                   April 2005


   The remainder of the discovery procedure is identical to that used to
   discover iSCSI targets, except that both initiators and targets would
   normally be "clients" of the storage management service.

   Targets that support a storage management service implement a UA in
   addition to the SA.  A target may alternatively just implement the UA
   and allow the storage management service to advertise its targets
   appropriately by providing an SA and registering the appropriate
   service:iscsi:target registrations on the target's behalf: The target
   device would not have to advertise its own targets.  This has no
   impact on the initiator.

   This allows the initiators' discovery of targets to be completely
   interoperable regardless of which storage management service is used,
   or whether one is used at all, or whether the target registrations
   are provided directly by the target or by the management service.

4.3.  Internationalization Considerations

   SLP allows internationalized strings to be registered and retrieved.
   Attributes in the template that are not marked with an 'L' (literal)
   will be registered in a localized manner.  An "en" (English)
   localization MUST be registered, and others MAY be registered.

   Attributes that include non-ASCII characters will be encoded by using
   UTF-8, as discussed in [RFC3722] and [RFC3491].

5.  iSCSI SLP Templates

   Three templates are provided: an iSCSI target template, a management
   service template, and an abstract template to encapsulate the two.

5.1.  The iSCSI Abstract Service Type Template

   This template defines the abstract service "service:iscsi".  It is
   used as a top-level service to encapsulate all other iSCSI-related
   services.

5.2.  The iSCSI Target Concrete Service Type Template

   This template defines the service "service:iscsi:target".  An entity
   containing iSCSI targets that wishes them discovered via SLP would
   register each of them, with each of their addresses, as this service
   type.

   Initiators (and perhaps management services) wishing to discover
   targets in this way will generally use one of the following queries:

   1. Find a specific target, given its iSCSI Target Name:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   initiator-scope-list
        Query:   (iscsi-name=iqn.2001-04.com.example:sn.456)

   2. Find all of the iSCSI Target Names that may allow access to a
      given initiator:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   initiator-scope-list
        Query:   (auth-name=iqn.1998-03.com.example:hostid.045A7B)

   3. Find all of the iSCSI Target Names that may allow access to
      any initiator:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   initiator-scope-list
        Query:   (auth-name=any)

   4. Find all of the iSCSI Target Names that may allow access to
      this initiator, or that will allow access to any initiator:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   initiator-scope-list
        Query:   &(auth-name=iqn.1998-03.com.example:hostid.045A7B)
                  (auth-name=any)

   5. Find all of the iSCSI Target Names that may allow access to
      a given CHAP user name:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   initiator-scope-list
        Query:   (auth-cred=chap/my-user-name)

   6. Find all of the iSCSI Target Names that may allow access to a
      given initiator that supports two IP addresses, a CHAP credential
      and SRP credential, and an initiator name:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   initiator-scope-list
        Query:   &(|(auth-name=iqn.com.example:host47)(auth-name=any)
        |(auth-addr=192.0.2.3)(auth-addr=192.0.2.131)(auth-addr=any)
        |(auth-cred=chap/foo)(auth-cred=srp/my-user-name)
         (auth-cred=any))

   7. Find the iSCSI Target Names from which the given initiator is
      allowed to boot:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   initiator-scope-list
        Query:   (boot-list=iqn.1998-03.com.example:hostid.045A7B)

   8. In addition, a management service may wish to discover all
      targets:

        Service: service:iscsi:target
        Scope:   management-server-scope-list
        Query:   <empty-string>

   More details on booting from an iSCSI target are defined in [BOOT].

6.  Security Considerations

   The SLPv2 security model as specified in [RFC2608] does not provide
   confidentiality but does provide an authentication mechanism for UAs
   to ensure that service advertisements only come from trusted SAs,
   with the exception that it does not provide a mechanism to
   authenticate "zero-result responses".  See [RFC3723] for a discussion
   of the SLPv2 [RFC2608] security model.

   Once a target or management server is discovered, authentication and
   authorization are handled by the iSCSI protocol, or by the management
   server's protocol.  It is the responsibility of the providers of
   these services to ensure that an inappropriately advertised or
   discovered service does not compromise their security.

   When no security is used for SLPv2, there is a risk of distribution
   of false discovery information.  The primary countermeasure for this
   risk is authentication.  When this risk is a significant concern,
   IPsec SAs and iSCSI in-band authentication SHOULD be used for iSCSI
   traffic subject to this risk to ensure that iSCSI traffic only flows
   between endpoints that have participated in IKE authentication and
   iSCSI in-band authentication.  For example, if an attacker
   distributes discovery information falsely claiming that it is an
   iSCSI target, it will lack the secret information necessary to
   complete IKE authentication or iSCSI in-band authentication
   successfully and therefore will be prevented from falsely sending or
   receiving iSCSI traffic.

   A risk remains of a denial of service attack based on repeated use of
   false discovery information that will cause initiation of IKE
   negotiation.  The countermeasures for this are administrative
   configuration of each iSCSI Target to limit the peers  it is willing
   to communicate with (i.e., by IP address range and/or DNS domain),
   and maintenance of a negative authentication cache to avoid
   repeatedly contacting an iSCSI Target that fails to authenticate.
   These three measures (i.e., IP address range limits, DNS domain
   limits, negative authentication cache) MUST be implemented.

   The auth-name, auth-addr, auth-cred, and boot-list attributes
   comprise security policy information.  When these are distributed,
   IPsec MUST be implemented.

RFC 4018                    iSCSI and SLPv2                   April 2005


6.1.  Security Implementation

   Security for SLPv2 in an IP storage environment is specified in
   [RFC3723].  IPsec is mandatory-to-implement for IPS clients and
   servers.  Thus, all IP storage clients, including those invoking SLP,
   can be assumed to support IPsec.  SLP servers, however, cannot be
   assumed to implement IPsec, since there is no such requirement in
   standard SLP.  In particular, SLP Directory Agents (DA) may be
   running on machines other than those running the IPS protocols.

   IPsec SHOULD be implemented for SLPv2 as specified in [RFC3723]; this
   includes ESP with a non-null transform to provide both authentication
   and confidentiality.

   When SLPv2 can be used to distribute auth-name, auth-addr, auth-cred,
   and boot-list information (see section 5.2 above), IPsec MUST be
   implemented, as these items are considered sensitive security policy
   information.  If IPsec is not implemented, auth-name, auth-addr,
   auth-cred, and boot-list information MUST NOT be distributed via
   SLPv2 and MUST NOT be used if discovered via SLPv2.

   Because the IP storage services have their own authentication
   capabilities when located, SLPv2 authentication is OPTIONAL to
   implement and use (as discussed in more detail in [RFC3723]).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes three SLP Templates.  They have been reviewed
   and approved by the IESG and registered in the IANA's "SVRLOC
   Templates" registry.  This process is described in the IANA
   Considerations section of [RFC2609].

8.  Summary

   This document describes how SLP can be used by iSCSI initiators to
   find iSCSI targets and storage management servers.  Service type
   templates for iSCSI targets and storage management servers are
   presented.
