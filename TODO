iSCSI DEVELOPMENT HOWTO AND TODO
--------------------------------
July 7th 2011


If you are admin or user and just want to send a fix, just send the fix any
way you can. We can port the patch to the proper tree and fix up the patch
for you. Engineers that would like to do more advanced development then the
following guideline should be followed.

Submitting Patches
------------------
Code should follow the Linux kernel codying style doc:
http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

Patches should be submitted to the open-iscsi list open-iscsi@googlegroups.com.
They should be made with "git diff" or "diff -up" or "diff -uprN", and
kernel patches must have a "Signed-off-by" line. See section 12
http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches for more
information on the the signed off line.

Getting the Code
----------------
Kernel patches should be made against the linux-2.6-iscsi tree. This can
be downloaded from kernel.org with git with the following commands:

git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mnc/linux-2.6-iscsi.git

Userspace patches should be made against the open-iscsi git tree:

git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mnc/open-iscsi.git



KERNEL TODO ITEMS
-----------------

1. Make iSCSI log messages humanly readable. In many cases the iscsi tools
and modules will log a error number value. The most well known is conn
error 1011. Users should not have to search on google for what this means.

We should:

1. Write a simple table to convert the error values to a string and print
them out.

2. Document the values, how you commonly hit them and common solutions
in the iSCSI docs.

See scsi_transport_iscsi.c:iscsi_conn_error_event for where the evil
"detected conn error 1011" is printed. See the enum iscsi_err in iscsi_if.h
for a definition of the error code values.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Implement iSCSI dev loss support.

Currently if a session is down for longer than replacement/recovery_timeout
seconds, the iscsi layer will unblock the devices and fail IO. Other
transport, like FC and SAS, will do something similar. FC has a
fast_io_fail tmo which will unblock devices and fail IO, then it has a
dev_loss_tmo which will delete the devices accessed through that port.

iSCSI needs to implement dev_loss_tmo behavior, because apps are beginning
to expect this behavior. An initial path was made here:
http://groups.google.com/group/open-iscsi/msg/031510ab4cecccfd?dmode=source 

Since all drivers want this behavior we want to make it common. We need to
change the patch in that link to add a dev_loss_tmo handler callback to the
scsi_transport_template struct, and add some common sysfs and helpers
functions to manage the dev_loss_tmo variable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Reduce locking contention between session lock.

The session lock is basically one big lock that protects everything
in the iscsi_session. This lock could be broken down into smaller locks
and maybe even replaced with something that would not require a lock.

For example:

1. The session lock serializes access to the current R2T the initiator is
handling (a R2T from the target or the initialR2T if being used). libiscsi/
libiscsi_tcp will call iscsi_tcp_get_curr_r2t and grab the session lock in
the xmit path from the xmit thread and then in the recv path
libiscsi_tcp/iscsi_tcp will call iscsi_tcp_r2t_rsp (this function is called
with the session lock held). We could add a new per iscsi_task lock and
use that to gaurd the R2T.

2. For iscsi_tcp and cxgb*i, libiscsi uses the session->cmdqueue linked list
and the session lock to queue IO from the queuecommand function (run from
scsi softirq or kblockd context) to the iscsi xmit thread. Once the task is
sent from that thread, it is deleted from the list.

It seems we should be able to remove the linked list use here. The tasks
are all preallocated in the session->cmds array. We can access that
array and check the task->state (see fail_scsi_tasks for an example).
We just need to come up with a way to safely set the task state,
wake the xmit thread and make sure that tasks are executed in the order
that the scsi layer sent them to our queuecommand function.

A starting point on the queueing:
We might be able to create a workqueue per processor, queue the work,
which in this case is the execution of the task, from the queuecommand,
then rely on the work queue synchronization and serialization code.
Not 100% sure about this.

Alternative to changing the threading:
Can we figure out a way to just remove the xmit thread? We currently
cannot because the network may only be able to send 1000 bytes, but
to send the current command we need to send 2000. We cannot sleep
from the queuecommand context until another 1000 bytes frees up and for
iscsi_tcp we cannot sleep from the recv conext (this happens because we
could have got a R2T from target and are handling it from the recv path).


Note: that for iser and offload drivers like bnx2i and be2iscsi their
is no xmit thread used.

Note2: cxgb*i does not actually need the xmit thread so a side project
could be to convert that driver.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Make memory access more efficient on multi-processor machines.
We are moving twords per process queues in the block layer, so it would
be a good idea to move the iscsi structs to be allocated on a per process
basis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Make blk_iopoll support (see block/blk-iopoll.c and be2iscsi for an
example) being able to round robin IO across processors or complete
on the processor it was queued on
(today it always completes the IO on the processor the softirq was raised on),
and convert bnx2i, ib_iser and cxgb*i to it.

Not sure if it will help iscsi_tcp and cxgb, because their completion is done
from the network softirq which does polling already. With irq balancing it
can also be spread over all processors too.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. When userspace calls into the kernel using the iscsi netlink interface
to execute oprations like creating/destroying a session, create a connection
to a target, etc the rx_queue_mutex is held the entire time (see
iscsi_if_rx for the iscsi netlink interface entry point). This means
if the driver should block every thing will be held up.

iscsi_tcp does not block, but some offload drivers might for a couple seconds
to 10 or 15 secs while it figures out what is going on or cleans up. This a 
major problem for things like multipath where one connection blocking up the
recovery of every other connection will delay IO from re-flowing quickly.

We should looking into breaking up the rx_queue_mutex into finer grained
locks or making it multi threaded. For the latter we could queue operations
into workqueues.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Add tracing support to iscsi modules. See the scsi layer's
trace_scsi_dispatch_cmd_start for an example.

Well, actually in general look into all the tracing stuff available
(trace_printk/ftrace, etc) and use one.

See http://lwn.net/Articles/291091/ for some details on what is out
there. We can only use something that is upstream though.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Improve the iscsi driver logging. Each driver has a different
way to control logging. We should unify them and make it managable
by iscsiadm. So each driver would use a common format, there would
be a common kernel interface to set the logging level, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Implement more features from the iSCSI RFC if they are worth it.

- Error Recovery Level (ERL) 1 support - will help tape support.
- Multi R2T support - Might improve write performance.
- OutOfOrder support - Might imrpove performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Add support for digest/CRC offload.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Finish intel IOAT support. I started this here:
http://groups.google.com/group/open-iscsi/msg/2626b8606edbe690?dmode=source
but could only test on boxes with 1 gig interfaces which showed no
difference in performance. Intel had said they saw significant throughput
gains when using 10 gig.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Remove the login buffer preallocated buffer. Storage drivers must be able
to make forward process, so that they can always write out a page incase the
kernel needs to allocate the page to another process. If the connection were
to be disconnected and the initiator needed to relogin to the target at this
time, we might not be abe to allocate a page for the login commands buffer.

To work around the problem the initiator prealloctes a 8K (sometimes
more depending on the page size) buffer for each session (see iscsi_conn_setup'
s __get_free_pages call). This is obviously very wasteful since it will be
a rate occurance. Can we think of a way to allow multiple sessions to
be relogged in at the same time, but not have to preallocate so many
buffers?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. Support iSCSI over swap safely.

Basically just need to hook iscsi_tcp into the patches that
were submitted here for NBD.

USERSPACE TODO ITEMS
--------------------
1. The iscsi tools, iscsid, iscsiadm and iscsid, have a debug flag, -d N, that
allows the user to control the amount of output that is logged. The argument
N is a integer from 1 to 8, with 8 printing out the most output.

The problem is that the values from 1 to 8 do not really mean much. It would
helpful if we could replace them with something that controls what exactly
the iscsi tools and kernel modules log.

For example, if we made the debug level argument a bitmap then

iscsiadm -m node --login -d LOGIN_ERRS,PDUS,FUNCTION

might print out extended iscsi login error information (LOGIN_ERRS),
the iSCSI packets that were sent/receieved (PDUS), and the functions
that were run (FUNCTION). Note, the use of a bitmapp and the debug
levels are just an example. Feel free to do something else.


We would want to be able to have iscsiadm control the iscsi kernel
logging as well. There are interfaces like
/sys/module/libiscsi/paramters/*debug*
/sys/module/libiscsi_tcp/paramters/*debug*
/sys/module/iscsi_tcp/paramters/*debug*
/sys/module/scsi_transport_iscsi/paramters/*debug*

but we would want to extend the debugging options to be finer grained
and we would want to make it supportable by all iscsi drivers.
(see #8 on the kernel todo).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. "iscsiadm -m session -P 3" can print out a lot of information about the
session, but not all configuration values are printed.

iscsiadm should be modified to print out other settings like timeouts,
Chap settings,  the iSCSI values that were requested vs negotiated for, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. iscsiadm cannot update a setting of a running session. If you want
to change a timeout you have to run the iscsiadm logout command,
then update the record value, then login:

iscsiadm -m node -T target -p ip -u
iscsidm -m node -T target -p ip -o update -n node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout -v 30
iscsiadm -m node -T target -p ip -l

iscsiadm should be modified to allow updating of a setting without having
to run the iscsiadm command.

Note that for some settings like iSCSI ones (ImmediateData, FirstBurstLength,
etc)  that must be negotiated with the target we will have to logout the
target then re-login, but we should not have to completely destroy the session
and scsi devices like is done when running the iscsiadm logout command. We
should be able to pass iscsid the new values and then have iscsid logout and
relogin.

Other settings like the abort timeout will not need a logout/login. We can
just pass those to the kernel or iscsid to use.


*Being worked on by Tomoaki Nishimura

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. iscsiadm will attempt to perform logins/logouts in parallel. Running
iscsiadm -m node -L, will cause iscsiadm to login to all portals with
the startup=automatic field set at the same time.

To log into a target, iscsiadm opens a socket to iscsid, sends iscsid a
request to login to a target, iscsid performs the iSCSI login operation,
then iscsid sends iscsiadm a reply.

To perform multiple logins iscsiadm will open a socket for each login
request, then wait for a reply. This is a problem because for 1000s of targets
we will have 1000s of sockets open. There is a rlimit to control how many
files a process can have open and iscsiadm currently runs setrlimit to
increase this.

With users creating lots of virtual iscsi interfaces on the target and
initiator with each having multiple paths it beomes inefficient to open
a socket for each requests.

At the very least we want to handle setrlimit RLIMIT_NOFILE limit better,
and it would be best to just stop openening a socket per login request.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Implement broadcast/multicasts support, so the initiator can
find iSNS servers without the user having to set the iSNS server address.

See
5.6.5.14. Name Service Heartbeat (Heartbeat)
in
http://tools.ietf.org/html//rfc4171

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Open-iscsi uses the open-isns iSNS library. The library might be a little
too complicated and a little too heavy for what we need. Investigate
replacing it.

Also explore merging the open-isns and linux-isns projects, so we do not have
to support multiple isns clients/servers in linux.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Implement the DHCP iSNS option support, so we the initiator can
find the iSNS sever without the user having to set the iSNS server address.
See:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4174.txt

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Some iscsiadm/iscsid operations that access the iscsi DB and sysfs can be
up to Big O(N^2). Some of the code was written when we thought 64 sessions
would be a lot and the norm would be 4 or 8. Due to virtualization, cloud use,
and targets like equallogic that do a target per logical unit (device) we can
see 1000s of sessions.

- We should look into making the record DB more efficient. Maybe
time to use a real DB (something small simple and efficient since this
needs to run in places like the initramfs).

- Rewrite code to look up a running session so we do not have loop
over every session in sysfs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Look into using udev's libudev for our sysfs access in iscsiadm/iscsid/
iscsistart.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. iSCSI lib.

I am working on this one. Hopefully it should be done soon.
