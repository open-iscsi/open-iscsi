		A summary of changes for meson

0. Executive Summary

   Warning: THIS IS AN ESTIMATION :)

   * added: 22 files / 797 lines, Mostly meson.build, but also 2 scripts
   * removed: 52 files / 45,242 lines (from autobuild, Makefiles, and .gitignore)
   * changed: 8 files / 53 lines (about 1/4 new, 3/4 bug fix)

   => So more than 25 less files, and more than 45,000 less lines
      (mostly from iscsiuio)

TODO: Update top-level README file, w/r/t make vs meson

0.5. High-level Changes

  Good:
  - Remove the two version files from usr and libopeniscsiusr
  - Remove all the autoconf files
  - Remove all the make files
  - Remove almost all the .gitignore files, since we don't
    build where the sources live
  - About 25% faster? (GET NUMBERS!)
  - Not as fragile, i.e. finds dependencies and needed programs
  - NO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

  Bad:
  - can't build in each directory now
  - Older systems don't create brcm-iscsiuio symlink to iscsiuio
  - libopeniscsiusr and iscsiuio man pages no longer build gzipped
    (but RPM install can handle that)
  - Older systems can't specify "sbindir", so binaries end up in 
    /usr/sbin (I _think_ I can work around this)
  - Users will need meson, and know how to use it (new README?)
