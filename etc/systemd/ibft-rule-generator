# When booted with 'ip=ibft' dracut will rename the
# interface to 'ibft*'. After systemd has started
# it'll try to rename the interface yet again with
# a persistent name.
# But as the ibft interface is already renamed _and_
# in use, the second renaming will fail and udev
# will complain.
# So add a dummy rule which signals udev the correct name
#
# Interface renaming happes at 80-net-setup-link.rules,
# so we need to hook in before that.
